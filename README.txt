My program was developed on Windows 10 in Microsoft Visual Studio.
To compile my program on the cs1.utdallas.edu server, I used the following command:
	g++ -std=c++1y -o id3 DecisionTree.cpp ItemTree.cpp Main.cpp
To run my program on the cs1.utdallas.edu server, I used to following command:
	./id3 train.dat test.dat
Where train.dat would be a file containing training data in the format outlined in the assignment.
Where test.dat would be a file containing test data in the format outline in the assignment.
